    How Lean Six Sigma Transformed a Small Café’s Operations
  </h1>

  <h2 class="blog-subtitle">
    A Brew Bliss Café case study on reducing variability, not just speed
  </h2>

  <div class="blog-content">

    <p>
      Brew Bliss Café in Pune was built on passion and customer experience. As footfall
      increased, operational cracks began to appear. Customers complained about long
      waits during peak hours, inconsistent coffee taste, and unpredictable service times.
      Despite staff working hard, outcomes varied.
    </p>

    <p>
      The core issue was not effort. It was process instability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using the <span class="highlight">DMAIC</span> methodology of Lean Six Sigma, a structured
      improvement project was launched to address service delays without adding staff,
      changing the menu, or redesigning the café layout.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Define Phase:</strong> Customer feedback was captured through Voice of Customer
      analysis, revealing that speed and consistency were must-have expectations.
      A SMART goal was defined: reduce average coffee delivery time to under five minutes
      during peak hours without compromising quality. A SIPOC map clarified process scope
      and ownership.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Measure Phase:</strong> Data was collected for each order from placement to delivery.
      Baseline analysis showed an average service time of 4.82 minutes, but with high
      variability. Service times ranged from just over two minutes to more than ten.
      The process sigma level was only 0.12, confirming an unreliable system.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Analyze Phase:</strong> Value Stream Mapping revealed significant non-value-added
      time spent searching for ingredients, handling special orders, and correcting mistakes.
      Fishbone and Pareto analysis showed that missing cutlery, unsorted ingredients, and
      special order confusion caused over 75 percent of delays. Five-Why analysis traced
      these issues back to lack of standard routines and visual controls.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Improve Phase:</strong> A Kaizen Blitz redesigned special order handling using visual
      cues and standardized steps. The 5S methodology was applied to ingredient and cutlery
      stations, introducing labeling, visual layouts, and setup checklists. These changes
      simplified work instead of adding pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Control Phase:</strong> Standard operating procedures, daily audits, and control
      charts were introduced to sustain improvements. Post-implementation data showed
      average delivery time reduced to 3.99 minutes, variability dropped sharply, and
      sigma level improved to 3.36. The process became stable and predictable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This case demonstrates a critical lesson for small businesses:
      <em>average performance hides instability, but consistency builds trust.</em>
      Brew Bliss Café did not grow by working harder. It grew by designing better systems.
